# 3D-tessellation

This is a project for exploring 3D tessellation structures using Processing 3.5.4 and iGeo library

iGeo Tutorial and library download: http://igeo.jp/tutorial/

The main file is in "Main" folder because Processing requires folder name to be the same as main file.

An output Object file is already in \Main\data
A rendered jpg file is in root folder
